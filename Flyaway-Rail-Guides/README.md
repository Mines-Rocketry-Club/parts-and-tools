- Note 1: length and quantity will vary based on desired spacing.  36 inches of rod will result in a spacing of 12 inches.
- Note 2: while not needed for basic functionality, nylon lock nuts may be desired for high reusability applications. Loctite #242 Blue thread locking agent is also applicable. Loctite #271 Red is not recommended for PLA renditions of the 3D printed components.
## Assembly Instructions
1. Print component contained in `Flyaway-Rail-Guides.SLDPRT` four times.
A high strength preset (one that uses many walls) should be used for these components. PLA is an acceptable material choice, provided that the rocket does not accelerate too quickly.
2. Deburr the 1/4-inch holes around the periphery of the component.
3. Using 1/4-20 threaded rod, cut three segments of the desired length.
4. Using the cut segments and nuts, screw two nuts onto each end of the threaded rod about 1.5 inches.
5. Insert the ends of the threaded segments into the peripheral holes and install the remaining nuts.
