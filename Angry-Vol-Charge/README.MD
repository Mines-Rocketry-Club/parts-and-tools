# Volumetric Pyro Charges
These are disposable parametric pyro charge containers.

## Assembly Instructions
### Modifying the Files
To produce a charge with desired volume, open the file `Volumetric_charge_cap.SLDPRT`, and modify the variable `Charge mass`.
### Assembly
 > **WARNING** This process involves working with black powder (and mass equivalents). Use of saftey glasses is strongly adivsed.
1. Prepare the modified files to print. Each cap (the component which holds the powder and is 'volumetric') requires exactly one hat (the sealing component which houses the electronic match). Print one hat per cap.
2. Fill the cap with black powder until it is flush with the top of the cap.
3. Ensure that no black powder is on the tapered sealing surfaces.
4. Thread the electronic match through the hole in the hat.
5. Press the hat onto the cap and apply cyanoacrelate based glue to the resulting seam.
6. Allow a few minutes to set before use.
### Modifications
If an even greater efficiency is desired or required, the completed charge may be wrapped with electrical tape.
Care should be taken when doing this, excessive confinement may damage the side walls near the charge.
